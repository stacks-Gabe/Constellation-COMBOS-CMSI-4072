Project Proposal Feedback
Project: Constellation Combos
=========================
Proposal Document [2 points]:
   Verbal Description:
      This section lays out a clear explanation of what the project does, as
      well as providing an explanation of the games goals during play.  You
      include a brief explanation of what knowledge from your courses the
      project will use.  However, this is very light on content and really
      only does minimal justice as a proposal.
   Justification Section:
      Because this document is so minimal, there really is no justification
      section.  You should re-read the requirements on the course website to
      be sure you understand what is required for future submissions.

Proposal Presentation [Slides and video] [3 points]:
   Slides:
      Nice work on the slides!  Very imaginative graphics, and you do a much
      better job here of describing what your project is "about".  I like
      the alien at the end...  :D



Summary:
--------

Not bad overall, but it doesn't seem that you put your heart into these
deliverables.

Will update after video is posted.


VIDEO EVALUATION
================
Good work on the presentation.  You seem to be talking from your knowledge
of the project and how it is constructed.  I think saving the actual game
description until the end is a novel approach to the presentation which
perhaps leaves the audience with a longer-lasting impression of the game
experience.

Good job overall.  Five out of Five points for this deliverable.

=================
SPECIFIC COMMENTS:

Problem 5.1 ~ correct

Problem 5.2 ~ techically correct, but reasoning contradicts itself and
   misunderstands local-only design.

Problem 5.4 ~ correct

Problem 5.6 ~  ClassyDraw is a desktop drawing tool; the expected answer is
   file-based storage (JSON/XML) rather than a database.

Problem 5.8 ~ Your machine doesn't handle exponents.

Problem 6.1 ~ correct

Problem 6.2 ~ Your diagram leaves out several concepts.  Rectangle and Star
   are Fillables, not types of Line.  Ellipse is also a Fillable.  Text is
   a subclass on its own, as is Line.  Revisit the ideas behind OOP and
   subclassing.


nice work!

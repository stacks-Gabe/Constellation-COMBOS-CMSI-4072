=================
SPECIFIC COMMENTS:

Problem 1.1 ~ This doesn’t answer the usual intent of 1.1 (e.g.,
   identifying/ordering lifecycle phases or enumerating required
   deliverables for a phase). It stays high-level and largely
   restates “document things well.”

Problem 1.2 ~ Partially addresses process/deliverables, but it’s very
   brief and omits many essentials typically expected (e.g., test
   planning/artifacts, review/traceability, acceptance criteria).

Problem 2.4 ~ correct

Problem 2.5 ~ correct

Problem 4.2 ~ correct

Problem 4.4 ~ correct

Problem 4.6 ~ correct

Problem 4.8 ~ doesn't actually address the main two problems as defined in
   the text

Problem 5.1 ~ correct

Problem 5.3 ~ Looks like an attempt to classify requirements (FURPS), but
   without tying items to categories or avoiding repetition. Lacks
   substance/examples.

Problem 5.9 ~ correct


not bad!
